Repository for deep learning course project - AI based position estimation based on radio frequency Project

# About
the scope of the project is cellular based UE localization for non-synchronized network power based approaches. The traditional approach(GPS) are triangulation based, those approaches rely on range estimation from known locations and it dependent on general consistent power range model. Such models is not accurate for some cases duo to Multi-Path / fading + low probability to detect more than one cell tower, localization is reduced to strongest cell or sector in the area and the error is dependent on the cell tower density.
